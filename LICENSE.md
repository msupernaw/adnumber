                ADNumber Commercial License(ACL)
                ================================
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   The license is non-exclusively granted to a single person or company,
   per payment of the license fee, for the lifetime of that person or
   company. The license is non-transferrable.
  
   The ACL grants the licensee the right to use ADNumber in commercial
   closed-source projects. Modifications may be made to ADNumber with no
   obligation to release the modified source code. ADNumber (or pieces
   thereof) may be included in any number of projects authored (in whole
   or in part) by the licensee.
  
   The licensee may use any version of ADNumber, past, present or future,
   as is most convenient. This license does not entitle the licensee to
   receive any technical support, updates or bug fixes, except as such are
   made publicly available to all ADNumber users.
  
   The licensee may not sub-license ADNumber itself, meaning that any
   commercially released product containing all or parts of ADNumber must
   have added functionality beyond what is available in ADNumber;
   ADNumber itself may not be re-licensed by the licensee.
